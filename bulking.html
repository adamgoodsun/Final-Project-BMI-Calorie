    <h1 class="text-center">What is Bulking Weight?</h1>
    <p>If your BMI is classified as underweight one way to normalize it is though a bulk. "Bulking is the muscle-gaining phase. You're meant to intentionally consume more calories than your body needs for a set period — often 4-6 months. These extra calories provide your body with the necessary fuel to boost muscle size and strength while weight training To varying degrees, body fat tends to accumulate during bulking due to excess calorie intake" (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking">Healthline</a>). When eating in a calorie surplus in combination with weight training, the extra calories will go towards building muscle. While a bulk can be done without training, it is not recomended unless you are severely underweight. This is because during a bulk you also put on alot of fat which can be unhealthy for your body. The muscular gains that can be made during a bulk will be limited without training. </p>
    <h1 class="text-center">How Can I Bulk?</h1>
    <p>In order to bulk you need to eat in a calorie surplus. This means eating above the amount of calories necessary to maintain your current body weight. It is possible to find an estimate of your maintainance calories by searching your current BMI on the internet. "Experts recommend consuming 10-20% above your daily weight maintenance calrie needs during the bulking phase for an average weight gain of 0.25-0.5% of your body weight per week. For example, if you need 3,000 daily calories per day to maintain weight, you should aim to consume 3,300-3,600 instead, depending on your experience level" (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking">Healthline</a>). If you are eating more than your maintainance calories, working out, and are not gaining weight at the expected rate; then you need to increase your daily caloric intake. </p>
    <h1 class="text-center">Know your Macros</h1>
    <p>It is also essential to understand how individual macronutrients that are found in food affect your body. "Macronutrients — carbs, fats, and proteins — are the nutrients that are needed in larger quantities in your diet. Carbs and protein each contain 4 calories per gram, while fat packs 9. Experts recommend that you get: 45-60% of your calories from carbs, 30-35% of your calories from protein, and 15-30% of your calories from fat" (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking">Healthline</a>). Protein is essential when on a bulk to build muscle and avoid putting on too much fat. You want to eat about a gram of protien per pound of bodyweight that you are bulking toward.</p>

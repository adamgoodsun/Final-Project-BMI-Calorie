      <h1 class="text-center">What is cutting weight?</h1>
    <p>If your BMI is classified as overweight one way to normalize it is though a cut. "A cutting diet is usually followed by bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts to cut body fat while maintaining muscle mass. The key distinctions from other weight loss diets are that a cutting diet is catered to each individual, tends to be higher in protein and carbs, and should be accompanied by weightlifting" (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cutting-diet">Healthline</a>). During a cut it is essential to eat in a caloric deficit or to eat less calories than your maintanance calories. </p>
    <h1 class="text-center">How should I cut?</h1>
    <p>It is recomended to also combine a cut with weight training in order to maintain muscle mass while losing fat. It is also possible to burn calories through cardiovascular exercise like walking on the treadmill. The main idea is to have less calories in your body that is needed to maintain your current weight causing your body to lose weight. "You can estimate the number of calories you need to consume daily to maintain your weight using an online calorie calculator. To lose 1 pound (lb) or 0.45 kilograms (kg) per week, simply subtract 500 calories from this number"(<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cutting-diet">Healthline</a>). It is essential that you do not eat in too large of a deficit or it will become too difficult to maintain. A healthy cut is gradual and does not starve you. If you wish to incorporate cardio it is essential to do low intensity cardio which burns fat before carborhydrates. An example of this is to walk on a treadmill on 3 speed, 9 incline for 30 minutes (my personal favorite way).</p>
    <h1 class="text-center">Know your Macros</h1>
    <p>On a cut you want to specifically target fat and eat more protien. "If you're on a cutting diet, you may need to eat more protein than if you're merely trying to maintain weight or build muscle mass. That's because while you're getting fewer calories, you're exercising regularly, which increases your protein needs. Most research suggests that 1-1.4 grams (g) of protein per lb of body weight (2.2-3.0 g/kg) is sufficient for conserving muscle mass on a cutting diet" (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cutting-diet">Healthline</a>). Good food to eat are ones that will fill you up with few calories. These food will be filling but low in calories like chicken breast. "Experts suggest that, on this diet, 20-30% of your calories should come from fat. One gram of fat contains 9 calories, so anyone on a 2,000-calorie regimen should eat 44-67 g of fat per day on a cutting diet"(<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cutting-diet">Healthline</a>). For carbs things like rice and pasta will be essential. "Because your body prefers to use carbs for energy instead of protein, eating an adequate number of carbs may prevent muscle loss. Additionally, carbs can help fuel your performance during workouts.On a cutting diet, carbs should comprise the remaining calories after you subtract protein and fat, or around 0.9-2.2 g/lb (2-5 g/kg) of body weight"(<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cutting-diet">Healthline</a>).
